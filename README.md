# SuccessionCLI 

Well, if you're here, you’ve probably heard of Succession: a tool used to reset devices with rootfilesystem DMG. 

# What does SuccessionCLI do?

SuccessionCLIRestore is basically succession, except that it is in CLI. 

# Why might someone use this?

A very good question indeed, this tool can be used to restore many devices at once through ssh over WiFi or USB, or to reset a checkra1n supported  device that isn’t fully working.
