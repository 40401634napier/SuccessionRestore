Well, if your here, you’ve probably heard of Succession: a tool used to reset devices with rootfilesystem DMG. However you now may be wondering what this does?
#What does SuccessionCLIRestore do?
SuccessionCLIRestore is basically succession, accept that it is in CLI. 
#Why might someone use this?
A very good question indeed, this tool can be used to restore many devices at once through ssh over WiFi or USB, or to reset a checkra1n supported  device that isn’t fully working.
