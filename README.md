this tool works in a similar way to succession although, it only uses cle: this means that this tool can only be accessed from the terminal. 
if you would like to compile yourself, you will need the following: 
Plutil (used to read values) found on Bingner's repo 
automaticssh (used to prevent disconnection of ssh) found on Bingner's repo
curl (used to download IPSW) found on Bingner's repo
rsync (used during restore process) found on Bingner's repo
